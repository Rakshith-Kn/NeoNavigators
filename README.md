# 🌍 NeoNavigators

Welcome to the demonstration of *NeoNavigators, our intelligent travel planning application powered by Agentic AI.

The objective of NeoNavigators is to provide travelers with a seamless, interactive, and highly personalized trip planning experience.  
The application leverages *Large Language Models (LLMs)* with a *destination-driven interaction* approach.  

Users can enter a location of interest, and the application dynamically generates comprehensive travel details — including top attractions, accommodation suggestions, transportation guidance, and even cultural or seasonal considerations.

The *Agentic AI methodology* enables NeoNavigators to operate as a semi-autonomous agent capable of reasoning, planning, and taking actions across different modules to fulfill the user’s travel request.
